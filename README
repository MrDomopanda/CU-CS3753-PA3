---Folders---
handout     - Assignment description and documentation.

---Executables---
 testscript - A simple bash script for running a few sample test cases.
 pi         - A simple CPU bound program for statistically calculating pi.
 pi-sched   - A simple program for spawning N pi processes using a
              specific scheduling policy.
 rw         - A simple I/O bound example program.
 rw-sched   - A simple program for spawning N rw processes using a
              specific scheduling policy.
 mix        - A simple mixed program form statistically calculating pi and
              writing the intermediate results to a file (pi + rw).
 mix-sched  - A simple program for spawning N mix processes using a
              specific scheduling policy.
 rr_quantum - A simple program for determining the RR quantum.
